# CMSC472-DL-Playlist-Generator
1) Create your own virtual environment using the command `python -m venv {virtual_environment_name}`.
2) Activate the environment using the command `source virtual_environment_name/bin/activate`
3) Navigate to the backend folder and run `python m pip install - r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies
4) After installing all the dependencies run `python app.py` to run the backend server
5) run the command `npm install` to download the necessary node modules
6) go to the root directory of your terminal and run the command `npx vite` to run the frontend :)

## Additional Notes
In case the frontend doesn't load the genres locally then it is probably an issue with the servers on which your frontend code and backend code are running. While, I don't think it should be an issue but if it is then please contact me and we can potentially debug it together ^__^

## Pending Tasks

- Updates need to be made to the recommendation card section.
